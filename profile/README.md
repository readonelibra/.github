# ELIBRA
We are a community that wants to empower authors, writers, publishers and readers. By 
allowing them to receive rewards for their action to be able to tip their favorite writers to 
be able to have community discussions with their favorite readers. 

So we want to develop a place for readers like a libra with many such functions and we will be using blockchain technology to get it done.

## WHY ELIBRA
## WHY BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
## WHAT WE PLAN TO BUILD
## HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE
